## Installation

* [Download](https://github.com/hiulit/Godot-3-2D-Day-Night-Cycle/archive/master.zip) the repository ZIP file.
* Copy `DayNightCycle.tscn` and `DayNightCycle.gd` in your project.
* Copy `Moon.tscn`, `Moon.gd` and `light.ong` in your project.

## Usage

### DayNightCycle

* Instance `DayNightCycle.tscn` and attach `DayNightCycle.gd` as a script.

You can change all these variables right from the Inspector.

### Tips

Instance one `DayNightCycle.tscn` in your background scene and another `DayNightCycle.tscn` in your main scene or level scene, etc. and set the **Day start hour** in the background scene a little after than the **Day start hour** in the main scene to have the effect that the background starts changing before the foreground.

```
Main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DayNightCycle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OtherStuff
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DayNightCycle
```

#### Example

* Background scene - **Day start hour**: 10.3
* Main scene - **Day start hour**: 10

Take into account that when using this effects you can have weird effect if you are using the **Moon**, because it will get called twice.

### Moon

**Warning!**

Before using the **Moon** you should know that it is intrinsically connected with **DayNightCycle**. This is were [singletons](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/singletons_autoload.html) come in handy.

This project has a `Global.gd` that serves as a **singleton**. Its function is to have `DayNight` and `Moon` always and everywhere available.

* Instance `Moon.tscn` and attach `Moon.gd` as a script.
* In `DayNightCycle.gd`, uncomment the following lines:

```
func _ready():
    # Global.DayNight = self
```

```
if cycle == cycle_state.NIGHT:
    # Global.Moon.change_state(1)

...

if cycle == cycle_state.DAWN:
    # Global.Moon.change_state(0.5)

etc
```
