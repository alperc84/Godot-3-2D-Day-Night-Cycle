## Installation

* [Download](https://github.com/hiulit/Godot-3-2D-Day-Night-Cycle/archive/master.zip) the repository ZIP file.
* Copy `DayNightCycle.tscn` and `DayNightCycle.gd` in your project.

## Usage

* Instance `DayNightCycle.tscn` and  attach `DayNightCycle.gd` as a script.

You can change the **Day start hour** right from the Inspector.


### Tips

Instance one `DayNightCycle.tscn` in your background scene and another `DayNightCycle.tscn` in your main scene or level scene, etc. and set the **Day start hour** in the background scene a little after than the **Day start hour** in the main scene to have the effect that the background starts changing before the foreground (as seen on the GIF above).
